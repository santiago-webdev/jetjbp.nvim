## Supported plugins
I created this colorscheme for personal use so it doesn't support that many
plugins as of right now:
- [gitsigns.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim)
- [lsp-inlayhints.nvim](https://github.com/lvimuser/lsp-inlayhints.nvim)
- [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)
- [nvim-semantic-tokens](https://github.com/theHamsta/nvim-semantic-tokens)

## Install
If you decided that you want to try it out:
```lua
-- Using packer
use 'santigo-zero/jetjbp.nvim' -- jetjbp.nvim
```
