open](https://github.com/santigo-zero/tests/blob/master/Screenshot_20220910_190828.png "Screenshot of neovim showing the jetjbp colorscheme")
_The font used in the screenshot is [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/) you
can get the font with the icons seen in the screenshot from the nerd fonts repo
[here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/Iosevka/Medium/complete/Iosevka%20Term%20Medium%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete.ttf)_

## Supported plugins
I created this colorscheme for personal use so it doesn't support that many
plugins as of right now:
- [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)
- [gitsigns.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim)

## Install
If you decided that you want to try it out:
```lua
-- packer
use 'santigo-zero/jetjbp.nvim' -- jetjbp.nvim
```

```lua
-- lazy
{
  "santigo-zero/jetjbp.nvim",
},
```
